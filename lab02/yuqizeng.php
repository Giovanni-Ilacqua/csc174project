		<h2>Entrepeneurship</h2>
		<p>“Welcome to Rebecca’s Kitchen!” My whole life, I have run successful businesses selling teddy bears, earrings, socks, milk tea, Chinese food, and senior pictures. My talent for business, though, started in my study room. I called it my coffee house. I sold cookies and drinks to my entire family, placing cookies and tea nicely on plates before I handed them to my “customers”. Five-year-olds must start somewhere. I slowly built the business. I wrote down the dishes my grandma made, set up the table and charged my parents for the meals; whenever aunts and uncles visited, I cooked noodles and proudly charged them 2rmb. My Hello Kitty cash register rang as I wrote receipts. Though I charged little, my real revenue came from my father; in a genius move, I charged him interest for never paying promptly. </p>
		<h2>Literature</h2>
		<p>I was never a literature person. Reading was terrible - the all-purpose sleeping pill. I had no appreciation of literature, and it was nothing more than a required course, and a box that had to be checked. But my attitude suddenly began shifting as I read Pride & Prejudice, and a new consciousness broke out as I read the sentence above. Since then, every book and short story I read gives me insight into the different ways to express one’s ideas. I have renewed respect for the power of the art of language. Every gesture and movement lead me into the psychological world, the human nature, of the characters, and, maybe even the author. I had to admit that studying literature has really helped me to better observe the people around me closely and choose the right reaction.</p>
		<h2>Cooking</h2>
		<p>Cooking is my passion, and how I express my emotions and my individuality. The tastes in cooking - sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness and spiciness - reflect life, and I believe that life influences the taste of every dish.  Through cooking, warmth and nostalgia flow into my life. Whenever I taste the sweetness in some dishes, it reminds me of my grandmother; whenever I taste the strong soy sauce flavor, it reminds me of my sturdy and wise father; whenever I taste the refreshment of vegetables, it reminds me of my resilient and generous mother. Cooking is a way to express my own feelings, a way to express my understanding of life and a way to be creative; but above all, it is my way to spread my positive view of the world to the people I care about, the community I live in and the society I’m grateful for.</p>
