		<p>I was never a student with perfect transcripts and standardized test scores; however, I always felt so lucky to find my passion – business – at such a young age, and always felt proud that I never gave up even when school tried to get in the way. My parents have two children – one is me and one is work. They didn’t want to miss the childhood of either of us, and, therefore, the great compromise was taking me to their work. I spent most of my childhood in stores, staring up at huge billboards. As I grew up, I became obsessed with how companies market themselves: the psychological tricks on every advertisement, the carefully timed promotions, the use of different media. A major in business started shining in the back of my mind.</p>

        <p>I am a Sophomore student studying Digital Media Studies and Business at the University of Rochester. More precisely, I am aiming at Marketing track within Business program. To me, there are huge correlations and opportunities that might occur when these two major meet each other. On the one side, you definitely need skills like visual design when you are marketing. On the other side, you also want to know how to promote a product that you design thoughtfully.</p>

        <p>I am a first-year undergraduate student at the University of Rochester. Entering the second semester of my college year, I keep my curiosity and passion for my college life with support from my friends, professors, and other nice people. This semester would be challenging for me as I take a heavier workload and more difficult coursework. Moreover, I felt the pressure of enduring the real Rochester winter in the next few months with snowstorms I have never seen before in my lifetime.</p>
