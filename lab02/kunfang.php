	<h2> My Major</h2>
	
	<p>However, it was not my intention to major in neither Digital Media Studies or Business at the first place. When I was in high school, my favorite subject was history. I enjoyed the process of  reading and thinking. After I successfully became the president of student union, my passion towards leadership and politics gradually grow in my body. I then get an internship in Congresswoman Mimi Walters’ local district office and applied for University of Rochester as a Political Science Major student. </p>

	<h2> My path toward DMS</h2>
	<p>Things seem to go smoothly, nevertheless, I knew something goes wrong after the first semester. Chronic tardiness lets my grade down and reveals the lack of interest. In the following semester, I tried out a lot of distinctively different courses. And eventually find myself in marketing course. My crew and I was told to develop a brand new marketing plan and write down a paper for an existing product. Although writing down the ideas are useful, I realized I need more skills to really make the plan happens. Things like designing a more stylish logo or improving the overall quality of its’ website require actual skills. I decided to further my knowledge, and therefore taking a few classes toward web design and digital media programming. Right now, I am still an amateur. But I want to explore more in the rest of my college life.</p>

	<h2> On my spare time</h2>
	<p>In addition, I have been learning piano since 3 years-old. If I could get a chance, I wish to take some AME courses and learn about sound recording. I also like to watch action and horror movies. The excitement you can get from these kinds of movies is like a dagger that strikes into audiences’ heart. I do want to know about the story behind the screen.I love skating, skiing, playing badminton for sports. During vacation time, I would spend a lot of my time trying all kind of extreme sports. Right now I have already completed my mission in paragliding and skydiving. I am really looking forward to bungee jumping one day in the future.</p>
