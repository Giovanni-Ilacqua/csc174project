			<h2>Sneakers</h2>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>Sneakers (also known as athletic shoes, tennis shoes, gym shoes, sport shoes, runners, or trainers) are shoes primarily designed for sports or other forms of physical exercise, but which are now also widely used for everyday wear. The term generally describes a type of footwear with a flexible sole made of rubber or synthetic material and an upper part made of leather, synthetic substitutes or cloth.</p>

				<h3>Brief History</h3>
					<p> Ã–tzi the Iceman's shoes, dating to 3300 BC, featured brown bearskin bases, deerskin side panels, and a bark-string net, which pulled tight around the foot.</p>

				<h3>Features</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Sole for protection</li>
						<li>Light shoelaces</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Boots</h2>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>A boot is a type of footwear and not a specific type of shoe. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality â€“ protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking), or may have hobnails on their undersides to protect against wear and to get better grip; and for reasons of style and fashion.</p>

				<h3>Brief History</h3>
					<p>The world's oldest leather shoe, made from a single piece of cowhide laced with a leather cord along seams at the front and back, was found in the Areni-1 cave complex in Armenia in 2008 and is believed to date to 3500 BC.</p>

				<h3>Features</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Sole for protection</li>
						<li>Sturdy shoelaces</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Sandals</h2>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>Sandals are an open type of footwear, consisting of a sole held to the wearer's foot by straps going over the instep and, sometimes, around the ankle. Sandals can also have a heel. While the distinction between sandals and other types of footwear can sometimes be blurry (as in the case of huarachesâ€”the woven leather footwear seen in Mexico, and peep-toe pumps), the common understanding is that a sandal leaves all or most of the foot exposed. People may choose to wear sandals for several reasons, among them comfort in warm weather, economy (sandals tend to require less material than shoes and are usually easier to construct), and as a fashion choice.</p>

				<h3>Brief History</h3>
					<p>The earliest known shoes are sagebrush bark sandals dating from approximately 7000 or 8000 BC, found in the Fort Rock Cave in the US state of Oregon in 1938.[4] </p>
				
				<h3>Features</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Sole for protection</li>
						<li>No shoelaces</li>
						<li>Straps</li>
					</ul>
